*Abstract.* This presentation seeks to offer a perspective of the discipline on the theme of the 13th International Research Forum on Statistical Reasoning, Thinking, and Literacy (SRTL-13): "Reconceptualizing data and data-ing." While "data-ing" is an unconventional term (i.e., not a word), it highlights a potential gap in our lexicon to describe how people engage and reason with data analogous to other dyads in our vernacular such as "model" and "modeling." The presentation includes a light-hearted discussion of experiences during my personal journey as a statistician in corporate/industry setting that have shaped my views as a statistician, educator, and researcher. My intention is to share my enthusiasm for the theme as SRTL-13 commences and to share my view of "data-ing" as a promising new avenue for statistics education research that seems to stand in a gap that as yet has perhaps been underappreciated despite what I believe is enormous potential for impact. The talk concludes with remarks on each invited session to be preesented at the SRTL-13 Forum.
